# Comp-Build-FrontEnd

- This will house the code for the frontend.
  - I have decided to split the app up into individual repositories as this would be more practical instead of using webpack to compress the front end and running it from a deployed Java back-end.
    - The reason I do the above is because the Java back-end is just an API so the API shouldn't really be an index file (any views for the user) and instead I just want it to be an API that requires authentication for certain endpoints.
